# wfirst_simulation

1. For the main simulation, use wfirst_simple_sim.py (includes multiple parameters; input shear, galaxy model, PSF model etc...)
   Main simulation returns the Metacalibration output in fits files. 
2. To analyze the shear response and observed shear, use selection_effects.py, which prints out the before and after we take care of selection effects on shear response.
